<p>Solway is a contemporary slab-serif type family. Defined by the soft corners, it has a welcoming and friendly appeal. Available in five weights, it is suitable for a variety of projects. Solway is a way of telling a personal story through inevitably impersonal geometry and portraying community-oriented values despite the reductive tendencies of an online world.</p>
